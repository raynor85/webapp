faq.title = Frequently Asked Questions
faq.subtitle = Probably an answer to your question

faq.question.1 = In short, what is Updapy?
faq.answer.1 = Updapy is an online and personal Update Center, aiming at Windows users. Updapy is a free service.

faq.question.2 = Why this service has been created?
faq.answer.2 = Windows Update works great for system updates, but there is no equivalent for all your personal applications (iTunes, Paint.net, Firefox...). You have to check manually if an update is available. As you have to do it on each application, this task is time-consuming and not very user-friendly.<br /><br />The purpose of Updapy is to manage all your application updates automatically by notifying you as soon they are available.

faq.question.3 = What Updapy is not?
faq.answer.3 = Updapy is not a centralized updates repository like the ones you can find on Unix-based systems (Ubuntu, Mac, Android...). Updapy will notify you when an update is available but you will have to download (and install) it by yourself if you want it.

faq.question.4 = In few words, why should I use such a tool?
faq.answer.4 = To save time: no need to check by yourself if updates are available! To keep your system updated: get the latest fixes and improvements for your favorite apps!

faq.question.5 = How does it work?
faq.answer.5 = You can follow applications in order to be notified when a new update is available for download. You can be notified by email or when login to your online Dashboard.

faq.question.6 = Can I trust updates from Updapy?
faq.answer.6 = Yes, install updates through Updapy is completely safe! All download links provided are from verified sources. We use the official Websites when possible and only trusted applications are available.  

faq.question.7 = I did not received the activation email!
faq.answer.7 = Maybe the email is in your Spam - Junk folder. No? When trying to connect, you can ask to get this email again by clicking on the link "Send me this email again".

faq.question.8 = Spam! I received too many emails!
faq.answer.8 = The fact that you are following many applications is a good point, but you are probably using the default notification option which is an email sent every time an update is available.<br /><br />We suggest you to activate the weekly digest feature, available from the Settings page. You can also deactivate completely all email alerts; you will be notified only when you connect to your Dashboard. Alternatively, you can deactivate email alerts on an application basis.

faq.question.9 = My favorite application is missing! What should I do?
faq.answer.9 = You can fill in the "Missing app form". You will receive an email as soon as the application is available.<br /><br />We cannot guarantee that your application will be added. The Updapy team will make sure to inform you by email why the application cannot be added (incompatible, blacklisted...).

faq.question.10 = I cannot find the answer to my question in this FAQ!
faq.answer.10 = The Updapy team will be glad to answer you! You can use social networks to contact us: we are on Twitter and Facebook.

faq.question.11 = I want to delete my Updapy account!
faq.answer.11 = To delete your account, go to the Settings page and click on the link "Delete my account", then follow the instructions. The Updapy team will not keep any information related to your account; you can read our Policy page to know more.
