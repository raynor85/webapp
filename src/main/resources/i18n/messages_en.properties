# 
# FAQ page
# 
faq.title = Frequently Asked Questions
faq.subtitle = Probably an answer to your question here

faq.question.1 = In short, what is Updapy?
faq.answer.1 = Updapy is an online and personal Update Center, aiming at Windows users. Updapy is a free service.

faq.question.2 = Why Updapy has been created?
faq.answer.2 = Windows Update works great for system updates, but there is no equivalent for all your personal applications (iTunes, Paint.net, Firefox&#133;). Only a minority of applications include auto-updates (Skype for example). And most of the time, you end up by doing a manual check for each application. This task quickly becomes time-consuming and is actually not very user-friendly.<br /><br />The purpose of Updapy is to manage all your application updates automatically by notifying you as soon they are available.

faq.question.3 = What Updapy is not?
faq.answer.3 = Updapy is not a centralized updates repository like the ones you can find on Unix-based systems (Ubuntu, Mac, Android&#133;). Updapy will notify you when an update is available but you will have to download (and install) it by yourself if you want it.

faq.question.4 = In few words, why should I use such a tool?
faq.answer.4 = To save time: no need to check by yourself if updates are available. To keep your system updated: get the latest fixes and improvements of your favorite apps. And last but not least, because it is free!

faq.question.5 = How does it work?
faq.answer.5 = You can follow applications in order to be notified when an update is available for download. You can be notified by email, by subscribing to a personal RSS feed or when login to your online dashboard. Also, you can personalize your updates by specifying some settings like your Windows architecture (32 bits, 64 bits) or your language (French, English).

faq.question.6 = Can I trust the updates coming from Updapy?
faq.answer.6 = Yes, install all your updates through Updapy is completely safe! All download links provided are from verified sources, we use the official websites when possible. And you will be able to follow only trusted and carefully chosen applications.

faq.question.7 = I did not receive the activation email!
faq.answer.7 = Maybe the email is in your Spam - Junk folder.<br /><br />No? When trying to connect, you can ask to receive this email again by clicking on the link "Send me this email again".

faq.question.8 = Spam! I am receiving too many emails!
faq.answer.8 = The fact that you are following many applications is a good point, but you are probably using the default notification mechanism which is an email sent every time an update is available.<br /><br /><ul class="fa-ul"><li><i class="fa-li text-color fa fa-chevron-circle-right fa-1x"></i>We suggest you to subscribe to your notifications RSS feed and deactivate completely all email alerts.</li><li><i class="fa-li text-color fa fa-chevron-circle-right fa-1x"></i>You can also activate the weekly emails feature, available from your settings page. You will receive a weekly digest once a week.</li><li><i class="fa-li text-color fa fa-chevron-circle-right fa-1x"></i>Finally, if you still want to receive an email for each update, you can also deactivate email alerts on an application basis.</li></ul>

faq.question.9 = My favorite application is missing! What should I do?
faq.answer.9 = You can fill in a "Request to add an application" from your dashboard. You will receive a notification as soon as the application is available.<br /><br />We cannot guarantee that your application will be added. The Updapy team will make sure to inform you by email why the application cannot be added (incompatible, blacklisted&#133;).

faq.question.10 = Does Updapy know which applications and versions I am using?
faq.answer.10 = Updapy is not intrusive and does not run a scan to check all files on your computer. But you don't really need to remember all the versions you have installed as we will notify you as soon as a new version becomes available, which means that you don't have it as it has just been published!

faq.question.11 = Why is it not possible to rate all applications available?
faq.answer.11 = The fact that you can rate only the applications you are following is intentional. Rate an application you are not using does not make much sense, you will probably give a poor rating. If you stop following an application, your vote will also be deleted. An application that has received a lot of (good) ratings is therefore a very followed application, and is probably also a good one. This rating system is thus much more reliable.

faq.question.12 = I cannot find the answer to my question in this FAQ!
faq.answer.12 = The Updapy team will be glad to answer you. You can use <a href="http://www.updapy.com/contact/" title="Contact form">this contact form</a> or also social networks to contact us. We are on <a href="https://twitter.com/updapy" title="Follow us on Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/updapy" title="Follow us on Facebook">Facebook</a>.

faq.question.13 = I want to delete my Updapy account!
faq.answer.13 = To delete your account, go to the settings page and click on the link "Delete my account", then follow the instructions. The Updapy team will not keep any information related to your account; you can read our <a href="http://www.updapy.com/privacy" title="Privacy policy">Privacy policy</a> to know more.
